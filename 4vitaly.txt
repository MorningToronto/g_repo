Good morning!

I like your new readme description:) 

Just did an interesting exersise - what happened, you accepted pull request and then made some changes to your repository.
So I was left with version of forked repo that was outdated now. Uparently one need not only add original repo (in this case
https://github.com/grevans/g_repo.git ) as a remote and fetch that repo, but also "checkout" and "rebase"... I'll add
screenshot to my repo how I did it, but basically I followed this: 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7244321/how-to-update-a-github-forked-repository 

Used shell lol. If we fix your GUI connection problems, you would also be able to work with GIT the way it supposed to be worked 
with. Using upload is a weird way to work with git:P You remember how I have fixed your WiFi? Should also take just a few minutes...

I could fix your problem using VNC, but that imply giving me a remote access to your notebook screen, keyboard and mouse. 
Well that would be password protected and after I finished you would be able to change password or uninstall VNC. But...
It somehow feels like not a good idea, plus I rather do it in person.

I bet without spellchecker my spelling is terrible. Feel free to fix any grammar spelling mistakes in msg above if you would be 
in a mood for that,
Vitaly
