Test repo for grevans

My username is "grevans" and I am writing a little bit about myself in this README as part of working on a "Hello World" tutorial. I created this repository so that I could learn how to use GIT. I have used other source code management software and thought this would be a good one to learn too. At first I found this extremely difficult to work with even though the concepts were familiar, but now I am finding it easier. It takes a commitment of time and effort to work through the scenarios. Anyways welcome and hello! -grevans
